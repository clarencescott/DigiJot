# DigiJot

## DigiJot Application (software)
DigiJot was created to utilize coding knowledge of C# to expand my skills anyway possible. My goal with this application was to focus on basic user interactivity with creating elements/methods (list items), and having the ability to interact with these elements/methods (save/delete). DigiJot was created to increase productivity by autosaving on window close so you can easily "jot" down your ideas and keep moving forward.

There will be additional features to come in the future, I am planning out the next release now as I speak. As of 08/01/24 This is release 1.0.1


### Release 1.0.1
- Initial Build and release of the application.
- Base features and functioning
### Release 1.0.2
- Update to list item background
- Cleaned up button styling
